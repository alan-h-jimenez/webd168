            <p class="fs-3">I've always been a bit of a wanderer, a spirit yearning for new experiences. From the rigors of the US Army to the serene beauty of South Korean landscapes, I've had the privilege of witnessing the world's myriad facets. One of my most memorable adventures was conquering the summit of Pikes Peak. The physical and mental challenge of that hike was immense, but the sense of accomplishment at the peak was truly exhilarating.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">Today, I find myself immersed in the dynamic world of technology. As a Salesforce Developer, I spend my days crafting innovative solutions and problem-solving. It's a role that allows me to blend my technical skills with a creative mindset.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">But my passions extend beyond the digital realm. In my downtime, I'm often found lost in the world of art. Whether it's the delicate strokes of a paintbrush, the rhythmic tapping of a chisel on wood, or the simple joy of sketching, art is my solace. The great outdoors also calls to me, and I frequently find myself hiking through nature's breathtaking landscapes.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">My love for learning is insatiable. Currently, I'm pursuing a Web Development Associate of Science degree at San Diego Mesa College. This journey has ignited a new spark within me, and I'm eager to explore the endless possibilities of the digital world.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">Life has been a whirlwind of experiences, each one shaping me into the person I am today. I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had, the challenges I've overcome, and the lessons I've learned. As I continue to grow and evolve, I'm excited to see what the future holds.</p>
