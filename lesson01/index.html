                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I enlisted in the U.S. Army at Chula Vista, CA and completed basic training at Fort Jackson, SC. I had achieved the rank of Sergeant by the time I left the Army after my second enlistment. My Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) was medical equipment repairer.</p>
                    <p>I was stationed at many locations during my military career including Fort Sill, OK; Camp Casey, South Korea; and Fort Carson, CO among others. I was deployed to Kuwait and Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p>
                    <p>After my military service, I have worked in a variety of positions and occupations. I have worked as a staff accountant, purchasing agent, compliance officer, et cetera. I am currently working as a back-end developer for a small company that primarily caters to government clients.</p>

                    <h2>Mesa College</h2>
                    <p>I have been taking classes at Mesa College for several years now. I completed all the requirements for the Associate of Arts, Mathematics degree and was awarded the diploma in 2020. I found out this year about the Associate of Science, Web Design program, and I enrolled in it for fall 2024.</p>
                    <p>My current employment has provided me with experience in back-end development. However, it has given me minimal experience in front-end development. My career goal is to become a full-stack developer as I feel that it would give me more career opportunities.</p>

                    <h2>Computer Programming</h2>
                    <p>I have been working as a back-end developer for a few years now, and my responsibilities are not limited to just coding. I regularly interact with clients to define requirement and delineate scope of work. I also design the solution architecture before it is implemented by myself or other developers.</p>
                    <p>My work is mostly focused on development of new applications or adding new functionality to existing applications. Although I have done some work in maintaining existing applications, I find that creating new features is more interesting for me as I get to build solutions from the ground up.</p>
                    <p>I have experience in multiple programming languages. I get to use some programming languages more often than others, so I find that I forget some aspects of those languages that I donâ€™t use as often. Because of this, I try to read and practice those languages outside of work. The following list is by no means exhaustive but it shows some of the programming languages I use more often:</p>

                    <h2>Leisure Activities & Other Interests</h2>
                    <p>I enjoy a myriad of artistic activities where I can channel my creativity. That includes drawing and different forms of painting such as sumi-e, watercolors, and acrylics. I have also dabbled in other creative activities such as wood burning, dot mandalas, and air dry clay to name a few.</p>
                    <p>I spend a lot of time outdoors, mostly playing with my dogs - Bruno and Franco. I am particularly drawn to areas that have bodies of water such as Mission Bay in San Diego or Lake Tahoe. However, I do love being in all types natural areas so I go hiking and camping in the desert and mountains.</p>
                    <p>I like traveling both in-country and overseas. I am fascinated by other cultures, foreign languages, and their cuisines. I make it a point to try the local food and learn some of the local customs. So far, I have only been to a few countries, but I want to continue visiting more in the future. Countries that I have visited are:</p>
